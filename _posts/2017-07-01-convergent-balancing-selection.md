Our lab has published findings on convergent balancing selection on the mu-opioid receptor in primates in *Molecular Biology and Evolution*.

**Research Focus:**
This study investigates convergent balancing selection on the mu-opioid receptor across primate species, identifying common polymorphisms in humans (A118G, C17T) and parallel variations in non-human primates including rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, vervet monkeys, marmosets, and squirrel monkeys.

**Key Findings:**
- Identification of functional polymorphisms in mu-opioid receptor across multiple primate species
- Demonstration of functional effects on downstream signaling following treatment with Î²-endorphin, morphine, DAMGO, and fentanyl
- Evidence of convergent evolution suggesting shared environmental pressures
- Implications for translational research and understanding addiction mechanisms
