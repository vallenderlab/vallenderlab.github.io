Dr. Vallender has published a comprehensive review on the genetics of human brain evolution in *Progress in Brain Research*.

**Research Overview:**
This comprehensive review examines the genetic mechanisms underlying human brain evolution, providing insights into the molecular basis of human cognitive abilities and neurodevelopmental processes through comparative genomics and evolutionary analysis.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Genetic changes associated with human brain evolution and cognitive development
- Comparative genomics across primate species to identify human-specific adaptations
- Molecular mechanisms underlying brain size and complexity changes
- Evolutionary perspectives on neurodevelopmental disorders and human cognition
- Integration of genomic data with paleontological and archaeological evidence
