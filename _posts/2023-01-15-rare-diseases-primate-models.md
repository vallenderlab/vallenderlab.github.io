We are excited to announce the publication of our collaborative work on nonhuman primate genetic models for the study of rare diseases in *Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases*.

**Study Overview:**
This comprehensive review examines the potential of nonhuman primates as genetic models for studying rare diseases, providing valuable insights for translational research and therapeutic development.

**Key Contributions:**
- Analysis of nonhuman primate genetic models for rare disease research
- Evaluation of translational potential for human rare diseases
- Discussion of ethical considerations and research applications
