        <p>The <strong>Vallender Lab</strong> is part of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Our research focuses on linking functional genetics across species to behavioral phenotypes in comparative genetic studies. This work helps reveal the roles of specific genes in human addictions and psychological illnesses, while also highlighting new areas of genetic and molecular research through cross-species comparisons.</p>
        
        <p>Our lab collaborates with scientists both within and outside UMMC to provide valuable insights for bioinformatic studies and translational research.</p>

        <h3><strong>Comparative Genomics of Neuropsychiatric Disease</strong></h3>
        <p>Understanding the genomic underpinnings of psychiatric disease is challenging due to complex genetic interactions and environmental factors. Our lab uses animal models to identify genetic variations that functionally act in parallel manners in non-human primates and humans, even when they don't share evolutionary origins. We explore conservation and divergence in genes associated with psychiatric disorders and investigate brain transcriptomics across species and phenotypes.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Evolution of Primate Brain and Behavior</strong></h3>
        <p>Understanding human brain evolution is critical for illuminating the origins of neuropsychiatric diseases and human-specific behaviors. Using comparative genetic and genomic techniques, we identify and characterize important genetic differences between species. Our studies have revealed correlations between evolutionary changes associated with human brain emergence and neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism, providing insights for disease understanding and treatment.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Substance Use Disorder Functional Genetics</strong></h3>
        <p>In the post-genomic era, we focus on clarifying the mechanisms by which genotype leads to diseased phenotype. Our work centers on G-protein coupled receptors, major drug targets associated with numerous diseases. We characterize genetic variation effects on ligand binding and intracellular signaling, particularly of the mu-opioid receptor, and establish associations with alcohol abuse, cortisol levels, and other behavioral phenotypes. This research also investigates how genetic variation mediates drug efficacy, such as naltrexone for alcoholism treatment.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Animal Model Development and Validation</strong></h3>
        <p>We work to improve animal models for biomedical research by providing comparative information on genotype/phenotype associations. Animal models are most useful when they replicate human disease and response. Using comparative genetics, we identify animal models with translational validity and strengthen existing models to maximize research utility. Our studies have identified naturally-occurring variations that both model disease phenotypes and may have confounding effects on research, improving study design and animal allocation.</p>
